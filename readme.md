**Skillable Community Course Contributions**

This repository is for collaboration, and constructive feedback so that we may continually grow, improve, and provide a better experience to learners and trainers. 

Skillable Community Courses use our modern challenge-centric instructional design model. This means that live hands-on labs are at the forefront of this course, allowing learners to learn while doing. Additionally, trainers are provided with the flexibility to address and demonstrate the “need to know” information based on an audience’s profile. To further promote and enable continuous learning, each Skillable Community Course includes access to additional reference materials and post class access to Skillable’s Challenge Labs. 

**We would like to hear from you**
